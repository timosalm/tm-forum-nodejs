        Is based on both the basic cost to develop and produce products and the enterprises policy on revenue targets. This price may be further revised through discounting (a Product Offering Price that reflects an alteration). The price, applied for a productOffering may also be influenced by the productOfferingTerm, the customer selected, eg: a productOffering can be offered with multiple terms, like commitment periods for the contract. The price may be influenced by this productOfferingTerm. A productOffering may be cheaper with a 24 month commitment than with a 12 month commitment.

        Resources are physical or non-physical components (or some combination of these) within an enterprise's infrastructure or inventory. They are typically consumed or used by services (for example a physical port assigned to a service) or contribute to the realization of a Product (for example, a SIM card). They can be drawn from the Application, Computing and Network domains, and include, for example, Network Elements, software, IT systems, content and information, and technology components.
        A ResourceSpecification is an abstract base class for representing a generic means for implementing a particular type of Resource.
